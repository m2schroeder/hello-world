# hello-world
First Git repository to learn how to use it
Made a branch called readme-edits
Not sure what I am doing at this point since I cannot figure out how to get Eclipse to hook to it??
It is all well and fine to have this repository out on the net, but I want to get this exact repository on my computer.
